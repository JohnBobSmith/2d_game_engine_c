# 2d_game_engine_c
A 2D game engine written in C using SDL 2for the graphics, 
and eventually Lua for scripting.

This project is a hobby project. The goal is to
have fun programming while learning the basics 
of working in 2D space, game engine code, and 
actual game mechanics and stuff like that. 

Libraries needed for compilation are:
-SDL2 
-SDL2_image
-SDL2_ttf
-SDL2_mixer.

All SDL libraries need to be version 2.
